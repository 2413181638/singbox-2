# SingXClient

A cross-platform graphical/CLI client built on the sing-box core and designed to connect seamlessly with the XBoard 2025 panel.  It automatically fetches subscription data from your XBoard server, generates a full **sing-box** configuration (supporting the latest protocols such as **Hysteria2**, **AnyTLS**, **VLESS+Reality**, â€¦) and launches the proxy engine.

The repository is shipped with a ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflow & GoReleaser configuration so that, once you push a tag, installers/binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** (universal binary), **Linux**, and **Android** will be built, packaged and uploaded to the release page automatically.

## Features

* ðŸš€ Zero-config runtime: just specify the XBoard subscription URL or token.
* ðŸ”Œ Supports all protocols currently implemented by sing-box (`hysteria2`, `anytls`, `vless+reality`, â€¦).
* ðŸ”„ Auto-refresh subscription & hot-reload sing-box without downtime.
* ðŸ“¦ One-command release workflow powered by _GoReleaser_.
* ðŸªµ Structured logging (JSON / console) & optional tray icon on desktop (planned).

## Quick start (development)

```bash
# Clone your fork, then:
make generate # install tools if necessary
make build    # local build for your OS/arch
./bin/singxclient --subscription "https://example.com/api/v1/client/subscribe?token=..."
```

## Building / releasing

Releases are handled automatically by GitHub Actions.  Tag a commit â€“ e.g.

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "First public release"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

A workflow will spin up, execute GoReleaser inside a matrix that targets all major operating systems and upload the artefacts to the _v0.1.0_ release page.
